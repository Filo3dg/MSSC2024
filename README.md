# MSSC 2024 - Modelling Solid State Chemistry

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the MSSC 2024 
(Modelling Solid State Chemistry) summer school! This repository contains all 
the necessary files, scripts, and resources that will be used during the 
tutorial sessions. MSSC 2024 will be held in London in September, and it is 
designed to provide participants with hands-on experience in the field of 
solid-state chemistry modeling.

## About MSSC 2024

The MSSC summer school is an annual event that focuses on the application of 
quantum-mechanical methods to the study of materials science. This yearâ€™s school 
will cover topics such as the use of 
[CRYSTAL software](https://www.crystal.unito.it) for electronic structure 
calculations, the simulation of periodic solids, and various advanced topics in 
solid-state chemistry.

For more information about the event, please visit the MSSC 2024 
[official webpage](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mssc/mssc2024/).


## Repository Contents
The repository is organized into two main sections: Basic and Advanced Tutorials. 
Each section is further subdivided into folders corresponding to each day of 
the school, ensuring that you can easily follow along with the material day by 
day.
